## [#333859 — Surface extensions blocked by the marketplace](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/pull/333859) at `src/vs/platform/extensionManagement/common/extensionGalleryService.ts:1394`

**[Experimental performance review bot]**

**Severity: medium**

The added blocked bit makes getValidRawGalleryExtensionVersion reject a version-blocked latest resource result. getLatestGalleryExtension then returns NOT\_COMPATIBLE, getExtensionsUsingResourceApi retries the affected IDs through a latest-only query, and queryGalleryExtensions rejects the same versions again before issuing its all-versions query.

Periodic and manual extension update checks that encounter a version-blocked latest release wait for two serial Marketplace POSTs after the existing resource fetches. On high-latency links this can add multiple round-trip times before VS Code can determine the usable older version and schedule updates.

**Suggested fix:** Propagate a distinct latest-version-is-blocked fallback result and batch those IDs directly into an IncludeVersions query, skipping the intervening latest-only query while preserving selection of an older permitted version.
